# Python 06: Functions, Dictionaries and Sets.

**Introduction**: This document presents learning steps for Python 06. In Python 06, you will learn dictionaries to collect keys and coresponding values. Moreover, you will learn more features of functions.

**Note:** Exercises of this learning path should be done using:

1. IDE: Using **BRef-01: Chapter 19, Section: Integrated Development Environment** PyCharm can be installed on your local machine.

## Materials:

The activities are designed based on these following references:

- **BRef-01**: Book, Bill Lubanovic; "Introducing Python: Modern Computing in Simple Packages"; [Available here](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/introducing-python-2nd/9781492051374/)
- **ORef-01**: Online Tutorial; Charles Severance; "Python for Everybody"; [Available here](https://books.trinket.io/pfe/index.html)
- **ORef-02**: Book, Brian Heinold; "A Practical Introduction to Python Programming" [Available Online, Check here](https://www.brianheinold.net/python/python_book.html)


## Path:

### Step-01: Dictionaries.

#### Goals:

```
After taking this step, you will be able to:
	1. interpret and implement Python programs with Python Dictionaries: creating, adding and modifying items,  extracting value(s), extracting key(s), deleting, pop and clear, iteration over dictionaries.
```

#### What to Learn?

1. Using **BRef-01: Chapter 08** answer and experiment the following questions:
   1. What is a dictionary in Python and how can you create a dictionary?
   2. How can items be added/changed to/in a dictionary?
   3. How can you get the value of a given key?
   4. What are the behaviour of these functions: *keys()*, *values()*, *items()*?
   5. When can we use *del*, *pop()* and *clear()*? Experiment with some examples.
   6. How can one iterate over a dictionary?

#### Exercises:

1. Describe in your own words the difference between a `dictionary` and a `tuple`.
2. Create a new dictionary containing a key named `FirstName` with the value `Larry`, a key named `LastName` with the value `Page`. Print the last value from the dictionary.
3. Create a dictionary with the following pairs `"brand": "Ford", "model": "Mustang", "year": 1964`.
	- Print all the values from the distionary.
	- Print all the keys from the dictionary.
	- Print the length of the dictionary.
	- Add `"color": "Red"` and remove the pair with key = `"year"`. Print keys and values separately.

4. Modify the code from the previous exercise so each value becomes a `tuple` containing two random numbers.

5. Provide your solutions to the exercises of **ORef-01: Dictionary**.

6. Design two exercises of your own. They should improve understanding topics of this step.

7. If you don't have PyCharm yet, install *PyCharm* on your working machine. Implement and run a simple Python program of your choice.
	- It is important to learn how to create a new Python program, how to configure interpreter and how to run the program. Where do you see the results?

8. **Extra:** Provide your solutions to the exercises of **ORef-01: Dictionaries**

### Step-02: Functions (more).

#### Goals:

```
After taking this step, you will be able to:
	1. interpret and implement Python programs with Python functions: positional arguments, keyword arguments, parameters default values, docstrings.
```

#### What to Learn?

1. Using **BRef-01: Chapter 09** answer and experiment the following questions:
   1. What are the positional arguments in Python? What about keyword arguments?
   2. How can one define default values for function parameters?
   3. What are Docstrings? How can they be helpful?

#### Exercises:

1. Describe in your own words what `*args` and `**kwargs` do.
2. Create a function that takes an `*args` of numbers as argument, which calculates the sum of all numbers and returns the result. Call the function and print the returned value.
3. Complete the given code below.

 ```python
def count_passes(**kwargs):
    count = 0
    #Complete this function to count the number of passes

    return count
#
result = count_passes(math="Fail", science="Fail", history="Pass", english="Pass")
print(result)
```


5. Design two exercises of your own. They should improve understanding topics of this step.

6. **Extra:** Provide your solutions to the exercises of **ORef-01: Functions**

### Step-03: Sets.

#### Goals:

```
After taking this step, you will be able to:
	1. interpret and implement Python programs with Python Sets: creating sets, difference between sets and lists and tuples, adding and removing elelemnts, membership operator, iteration over a set, basic operations between sets: intersection, union, difference and subset.
```

#### What to Learn?

1. Using **BRef-01: Chapter 08** answer and experiment the following questions:
   1. What is a set in Python and how is it defined?
   2. How can one add/remove elements to/from a set?
   3. How can one iterate over a set?
   4. Assume two sets S1 and S2. How can one specify the following operations on S1 and S2 in Python:
	   - Intersection of S1 and S2.
	   - Union of S1 and S2.
	   - Difference S1 and S2.
	   - Is S1 a subset of S2 (or vice-versa)?

#### Exercises:

1. Describe in your own words the difference between a `set` and a `tuple`.
2. Describe in your own words the difference between a `set` and a `list`.
3. Create a set with and fill it with some values you can think of yourself. Print the length and the last value from the set.
3. Create a function which takes a `dictionary` as argument and returns a `set` created from the values of the given `dictionary`. Call the function and print all values from the returned set.
4. Create a `set` containing 5 letters `x,y,q,z,u`. Ask the user the input a letter. Check with `if` statement if the given letter is inside the `set`, print `yes` or `no`.

5. Design two exercises of your own. They should improve understanding topics of this step.

## Code Analysis
1. Analyze the given code below without executing it. What will be the result of the program?

 ```python
def do_something(*args, **kwargs):
    for i in args:
        for key, value in kwargs.items():
            if i == key:
                print(value)
#
#
do_something("a", "z", "d", "b", a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4)
```
2. Analyze the given code below without executing it. What will be the result of the program?

 ```python
sfind = set('orihme')
schar = set('ichgo')
print("Step 1:")
for i in sfind:
    if i in schar:
        print(i)
#
print("Step 2:")
schar.update(sfind)
for i in schar:
    print(i)
```
3. Given the following code below. Explain in your own words what happens in this code. What are the keys in the dictionary?

 ```python
import random
rdic = {}
for i in range(0,10):
	rdic[i] = random.randint(0,100)
for item in rdic.values():
	print(item)
```
