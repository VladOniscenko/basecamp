# Python 13: Databases - part 1.

**Introduction**: This document presents learning steps for Python 13. In Python 13, you will learn the basics of implementing Python programs that can interact with databases.

**Note**: In this phase, it is expected the learner can plan and run the required learning process towards the goals of the week: making solutions to the given problems and product(s).

## Materials:

The activities are designed based on these following references:

- **BRef-01**: Book, Bill Lubanovic; "Introducing Python: Modern Computing in Simple Packages"; [Available here](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/introducing-python-2nd/9781492051374/)
- Free research.

## Path:

### Step: Databases.

#### Goals:

```
After taking this step, you will be able to:
	1. understand the concept of databases.
	2. understand and implement Python programs making basic queries in SQLite: SELECT x,y,z FROM t WHERE c.
```
#### What to learn?

1. Using **BRef-01, Chapter 16: Relational Databases** make a plan for the week to learn basics of Python programs interacting with relational databases.
	- Make an overview of the provided problems and final product.
	- Plan what you need to learn in order to provide your solutions.
	- Read proposed book chapter and practice basic steps.
