# Python 09: Everything is an Object.

**Introduction**: This document presents learning steps for Python 09. In Python 09, you will get introduced with classes and objects in Python. This will be the first step in Object Oriented Programming in Python.

**Note**: In this phase, it is expected the learner can divide the program into smaller learning steps. The goal and direction of the topics will be provided. The learning must take smaller steps towards the goals such that can implement solutions to the given problems and product(s).

## Materials:

The activities are designed based on these following references:

- **BRef-01**: Book, Bill Lubanovic; "Introducing Python: Modern Computing in Simple Packages"; [Available here](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/introducing-python-2nd/9781492051374/)
- **ORef-01**: Online Tutorial; Charles Severance; "Python for Everybody"; [Available here](https://books.trinket.io/pfe/index.html)


## Path:

### Step: Class and Object.

#### Goals:

```
After taking this step, you will be able to:
	1. interpret and implement Python programs with Python objects and classes: defining a class, instantiating an object, attributes and methods, initializing and object.
	2. understand the concepts of namespace and scope in Python programs.
```

#### What to Learn?


1. Using **BRef-01: Chapter 10** answer and experiment the following questions:
   1. What is an Object in Python?
   2. What is a class and how can you define a class in Python? Make an example.
   3. How can you create and use an object from a class? Experiment with examples.
   4. What are attributes? How they help programmers to encapsulate their data values?
   5. What is a method? Focus only on *instance methods*.
   5. How can you initialize an instance (object)? Implement a class with **__init__** method.


#### Exercises:

1. Design at least ten different exercises of your own. They should improve understanding topics of this step. Share your exercises with your learning community and practice.

## Learning Activities:

### Code Analysis

[todo: a sample code is coppied below just as a raw idea.]

```python
class Book:
    def __init__(self, book_title, author_first_name, author_last_name):
        self.title = book_title
        self.author_fname = author_first_name
        self.author_lname = author_last_name

    def view_info(self):
        print(f"Title: {self.title}")
        print(f"Author: {self.author_fname} {self.author_lname}")


def main():
    # Creating Book objects and associating them with authors
    books = []
    book_1 = Book('Introducing Python','Bill','Lubanovic')
    books.append(book_1)
    book_2 = Book('The Python Workbook','Ben','Stephenson')
    books.append(book_2)

    # Displaying book information
    for b in books:
        b.view_info()

main()
```

### Supporting Topics
[Encapsulation in OOP with examples in Python]

### Extra topics
The follwoing concepts are not part of the main learning path, but can be considered as *optional* learning steps for those who seek more challenges:

- Inheritance
- Polymorphysm
- Class methods
- Static methods
- Duck Typing
- Magic methods
- Aggregation and Composition
- Dataclasses
